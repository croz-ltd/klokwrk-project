# Project Klokwrk
Project Klokwrk is envisioned at [CROZ](https://croz.net/) as a showcase and blueprint for implementing elaborated distributed systems on JVM. It should also serve as a playground for incubating
reusable libraries useful on its own.

The vision behind Klokwrk could be expressed in different ways, but essentially we could put it like this:
- FOR software architects and teams
- WHO are building microservice systems
- THE Klokwrk is a showcase and a blueprint
- THAT demonstrates how to set up the clean technical architecture of a complex system properly
- UNLIKE many Hello World examples that focus narrowly on just proving the concept
- OUR PRODUCT represents a holistic foundation/showcase that better addresses real-world challenges by leveraging DDD, Clean Architecture, CQRS & Event Sourcing principles, and relying on the power
  and expressiveness of Spring Boot, Axon, and Groovy.

Being a showcase, Klokwrk tries to be complete and ready to be used as a starting point in your next project. It brings the initial structures and mechanisms to help you maintain a sustainable design
from a clean foundation. Klokwrk will strive to demonstrate good practices on non-trivial use cases, accompanying them with appropriate documentation.

At the moment, Klokwrk is in its incubation, and we are still thinking about what would be interesting to include and how. Despite this, we decided to show it to the open-source community. Although
in its very early stages, we are hoping it might attract some attention and feedback.

A much broader story about Project Klokwrk's vision and roadmap can be found in the following blog posts:

- [Why Hello World examples are bad for clean architecture?](https://croz.net/news/why-hello-world-examples-are-bad-for-clean-architecture/)

Klokwrk is an open-source project, started by [Damir Murat](https://github.com/dmurat), one of our senior architects, with the active contribution of the broader [team](https://croz.net/) at
[CROZ](https://github.com/croz-ltd).
