# cargotracking-domain-model-aggregate

Module `cargotracking-domain-model-aggregate` contains domain aggregates and entities (in DDD terms) for the `cargotracking` bounded context.

Regarding naming, we choose the term `aggregate` over `entity` as `entity` is highly overloaded. However, in DDD terminology, this module is intended as a home of DDD `cargotracking` entities,
some of which are DDD aggregates as well.
