## Decision
[This section describes our response to forces from Context. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will â€¦". Here we can also include links to external sources, but in that case
external sources should also be listed in References section]

### Decision details (optional)
[When 2-3 sentences are not enough to explain decision, "Decision details" can be used for detailed, but still short enough, elaboration.]

## Consequences
[This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative,
and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.]

## Considered Options
[None | list of all considered options preferably including their description and rejection reasoning]

[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) template.]

## References
[None | list of all useful references including short description of reference content]

[If contributing to the clarity, references can be organized into appropriate sections.]
