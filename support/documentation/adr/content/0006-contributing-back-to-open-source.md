# ADR-0006 - Contributing Back to Open Source
* **Status: accepted**
* Dates: proposed - 2020-11-02
* Authors: Damir Murat (`damir.murat.git at gmail.com`)
* Reviewers: None

## Context
Quite often, in commercial projects, reporting back to the community is entirely in the developer's hands. They are allowed to do this, but commonly there is no dedicated time in the plans.

One of the ideas behind Project Klokwrk is to streamline development efforts as much as possible. As we are using many different open-source tools and libraries, it is in our best interest to try to
help with the issues we encountered.

### Architectural Context
* System (`klokwrk-project`)

## Decision
**At least, we will report the issues in 3rd party open source software that are encountered during `klokwkr-project` development.** We'll strive to do this as consistently as possible. Besides being
constructive community members, resolving encountered issues should benefit us with an easier and streamlined workflow.

We will actively maintain [the list of reported issues and monitored issues](../../misc/klokwrkRelatedIssuesInTheWild.md) that are relevant for `klokwkr-project.`

Putting open source contribution in ADR makes it an official guideline and moral obligation for all `klokwrk-project` members.

## Consequences
### Positive
* To be a constructive member of the open source community.
* To simplify our own workflows.

### Negative
* Working on 3rd party software issues requires significant time.

### Neutral
* Contributing back to open source is an obligation for each member of `klokwrk-project`.

## Considered Options
* Do not contribute back.
